                <p> Hello! I'm Johnny Ung,
                    A Full Stack Developer
                    From Los Angeles, CA.
                    After graduating with a bachelorâ€™s in biology, I found myself in a stable career as a microbiologist for a major brewery. While the idea of working at a brewery was definitely a great conversation starter, I realized that although I still had a love for science, the industry I was in was lacking in creativity and problem solving. After dabbling with some introductory JavaScript courses on the internet and exploring programming through self-teaching, I decided to take a leap of faith and made a switch in careers into tech.
                    
                    Through LearningFuze, I have developed a strong understanding of JavaScript (ES5 & ES6), React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, HTML5, and CSS3. As a developer, I find a lot of joy and excitement utilizing my skills to help troubleshoot bugs and pushing projects forward. I enjoy learning new technologies and growing in a field that is constantly being pushed to new boundaries.
                    
                    Feel free to connect with me! Let's talk about web dev, tech, sports, photography, video games, cooking, or how I can be of help to your team or business! I'd love to get to know more developers and expand my network. I also know a thing or two about beer. </p>
